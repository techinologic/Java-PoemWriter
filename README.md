# PoemWriter
#### Coding Challenge SPR2018 #3: Due Monday, April 2, 2018 @ 5pm
#### Write a java class that creates a file, your favorite poem to a file, 
#### and then prints the content of that file on the screen. 
#### Your class should ask the user for the name of the file and path where the file should be stored.  
#### The name of the file should also be written/stored on the top line of the file.

#### Your code should use exception handling, appropriate documentation comments, 
#### and you should print out as much information about the file as possible.  This will make more sense when you read more about the file #### and files classes in the java.io package.
