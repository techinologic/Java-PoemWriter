Sweet Little Angel by B.B. King 

I've got a sweet little angel 
I love the way she spread her wings 
Yes got a sweet little angel 
I love the way she spread her wings 
Yes, when she spreads her wings around me 
I get joy, and everything 
You know I asked my baby for a nickel 
And she gave me a $20 bill 
Oh yes, I asked my baby for a nickel 
And she gave me a $20 bill 
Whoah, you know I ask her to buy a little drink of liquor 
And she gave me a whiskey still 
Oh, if my baby should quit me 
I believe I would die 
Oh if my baby should quit me 
Lord I do believe I would die 
Yes if you don't love me little angel 
Please tell me the reason why
